This is a bluetooth beacon detecting plugin with coded trilateration algorithm for the app to determine user's postion

Any beacons can be used , this project uses IBeacon and the IBEacon Plugin from unity asset store (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/ibeacon-15260)

To test out the function, create a 2D map of your location and fill in the beacon position in the example script inspector. Build the apk and fill in necessary information (for more info , read the Ibeacon Documentation). Click "calculate" to print the user position in vector 2 format (X,Y)
